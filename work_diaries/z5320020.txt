OUTSIDE OF LAB
- Researched other examples on the car space rental system and made notes on their 
colour schemes and overall functionality flow such as how user registration progressed, 
or listing cars progressed.
- Created user stories for features that I determined to be apart of the minimum 
viable product for the first/second sprint. Also included acceptance criterias 
for these too.
- Started looking at storyboarding for these features too.
