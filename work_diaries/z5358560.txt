Week 1 Project Diary

We formed/created the group and selected the Scrum Master (Mani). Mani created
the Jira site and together we decided on Project 5 Car Space Rental. We
discussed our preferred languages and libraries and decided on a Python backend
and React/JavaScript frontend. We also discussed initial ideas for novel
functionalities (including a map). We decided on a weekly date to meet up and
created the document for the project proposal.
