Week 1

We formed/created the group and selected the Scrum Master (Mani). Mani created
the Jira site and together we decided on Project 5 Car Space Rental. We
discussed our preferred languages and libraries and decided on a Python backend
and React/JavaScript frontend. We also discussed initial ideas for novel
functionalities (including a map). We decided on a weekly date to meet up and
created the document for the project proposal.

Week 2

We assigned work for the proposal together. I created all the issues in Jira
and organised them into specific epics for each of our functionalities. I also
created the system architecture diagram and wrote short descriptions for each
section as well as the external actors for the proposal.
