Week 1

We formed/created the group and selected the Scrum Master (Mani). Mani created
the Jira site and together we decided on Project 5 Car Space Rental. We
discussed our preferred languages and libraries and decided on a Python backend
and React/JavaScript frontend. We also discussed initial ideas for novel
functionalities (including a map). We decided on a weekly date to meet up and
created the document for the project proposal.

Week 2

We assigned work for the proposal together. I created all the issues in Jira
and organised them into specific epics for each of our functionalities. I also
created the system architecture diagram and wrote short descriptions for each
section as well as the external actors for the proposal.

Week 3

We finished off writing the proposal and Anthony and I started scaffolding the
backend. I did some research into how MongoDB worked with Python and set up an
Atlas cluster for our project development. I also did some research into how
Flask Blueprints work so that our file structure can be more modular

Week 4

We worked on completing sprint 1. I completed the routes, database access and
testing for registering, updating and deleting car spaces as well as user
management routes and general GET routes. I also added tokening and wrote up
the documentation for our api and database in a markdown file as we decided
swagger was unnecessary for our project.
